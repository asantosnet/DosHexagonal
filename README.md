# DosHexagonal

Project made for a numerical simulation lecture taken during my M1 of physics at UGA. 

Project  made with FLorie Mesple. 

The objective is to obtain de DOS of an honeycomb lattice using a numerical and analytical approach. The results obtained from the numerical approach are then used to obtain the Chern number. 

There is apparently a problem with the Chern number calculation and the result obtained is not correct. 

More information on the report.
